SONAR is a Waters-licensed form of scanning quadrupole data independent tandem mass spectrometry.  In the original Waters formulation, the quadrupole scans a particular mass range with a mass width over a period of time, first using low collision energy settings, then high collision energy settings.  The precise mass isolation width of the quadrupole is best defined through a calibration approach.  
    
With traditional SONAR, the low collision energy function 1 data can be used to calibrate the function 2 data. With a custom hybrid-Sonar approach, the calibration must be generated from one file, and applied to others.  
    
This calibration approach is current performed by using signal detection, then calibration of detected signal against sonar isolation bin (0-199).  This package enables versatile calibration of SONAR isolatoin bin range for both traditoinal SONAR and a custom hybrid-SONAR, where low collision energy SONAR as function 1 is replaced with a standard MS1 survey scan to maximize sensitivity and duty cycle. 
    
In the hyrbid SONAR, there is no SONAR scanning performed at low collision energy, so to enable calibration the user is instructed to generate the SONAR acquisitoin file where function 1 is an MS survey scan at low collisoin energy.  Function 2 is an MS survey scan, with the 'Sonar' option turned on and parameters set as desired.  Once this file has been saved, the user should save a copy as FileName_lowCE.exp where the collision energy is lowered from the desired setting to 6. This will result in the file being otherwise identical to the original file, but with low collision energy settings. 
    
These low collision energy settings allow more accurate calibration of the SONAR isolation width by bin.   The calibration process is executed in a two step process: (1) perform calibration and (2) apply calibratoin to new data.  In this way each file need not be calibrated anew, we just apply the calibration when the relvent instrument parameters are identical. 
    
Once the method has been created, the user should acquire data using the _lowCE.exp method and use the 'generate.sonar.calibration' function to create a new calibration which can be saved.  Doing so as a separate step ensures that your method is valid and the calibration quality is good. After this has been done, the user can collect data using the original high collision energy hyrbid SONAR method. 
    
A calibration can be applied to new data whenever the calibration and new data are collected on the same instrument (serial number) using the same version of MassLynx (including SCN), and the sonar scan time, interscan delay, start mass, stop mass, and quad isolation width settings are identical.  If any of these values change, a new '_low.CE.exp' method should be created. Applying a calibration will not permanently change any of the original data in the .RAW directory _except_ to add/modify _sonar.inf, which contains the calibration and sonar acquisition information.  This file will be recognized by proteowizard or masslynx to ensure the displayed MS/MS data is appriately labelled.
